<p>Welcome to Next Thing Co documentation.</p>

          <h1 id="proposed-table-of-contents-for-chip-documentation">Proposed Table of Contents for CHIP Documentation</h1>

<p>A hierarchy of topics and subjects. You may just want to look at the table of contents on the right, since the indentations make it easier to see the tree.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-derp">Welcome to DERP</h2>

<p>We made a computer. <em>A $9 computer</em>. And every computer needs an operating system. </p>

<p>Ours is <strong>DERP</strong>: <strong>D</strong>ebian <strong>E</strong>nvironment for <strong>R</strong>adical <strong>P</strong>roducts. Grab an old TV (or any screen with a composite video input), a keyboard and mouse, and stick some electricity  in the micro USB port. In a few seconds, you&rsquo;ll have CHIP&rsquo;s DERP on your screen, ready for your commands. </p>

<p>CHIP is built for making - we&rsquo;ve packed a powerful processor, 8 GB of storage, stereo audio, video out,  and lots of connections for playing and making your projects and products. </p>

<p>DERP is built for doing. You probably didn&rsquo;t expect to be able to browse the &lsquo;net, send email, play video games, listen to music, write a novel, watch a video, or learn programming. And because it&rsquo;s based on the popular linux debian, if there&rsquo;s something you need, you can probably install it. </p>

<p>So how do use this thing? Read on and learn how much you can do. </p>

<h3 id="start-chip">Start CHIP</h3>

<p>First things first. Let&rsquo;s boot CHIP into DERP and do some computer things! Add some power, then we can turn on the wireless network, and even connect a bluetooth keyboard to get rid of those annoying cables.</p>

<h4 id="power-up">Power up</h4>

<p>The single most important thing to using any electronic device is getting electricity to the right places. This tutorial covers how to turn CHIP &ldquo;on&rdquo;. This might seem so straightforward that it doesn&rsquo;t deserve several paragraphs, but CHIP is pretty clever, so there&rsquo;s actually a few things worth knowing.</p>

<h5 id="what-39-s-it-need">What&rsquo;s It Need?</h5>

<p>In general, CHIP is powered by a 5-volt source like a USB port or phone charger, and draws about 300mA peak (at boot time), runs on around 100mA, and rests with around 80mA with the processor totally unloaded. This may be more than you need to know if you just want to plug it in to the wall, but, as you build projects with CHIP, you&rsquo;ll be happy to know there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to get the electricity flowing.</p>

<h5 id="how-do-i-know-chip-is-on">How Do I Know CHIP Is On?</h5>

<p>CHIP is silent. It doesn&rsquo;t take much energy, so it&rsquo;s not very hot. It has no discernible smell. As a result, many of your senses are not great indicators that it is working. There are two LEDs next to the USB micro connector. When CHIP is on, you should see the <code class="prettyprint">PWR</code> LED light up nice and bright.</p>

<h5 id="power-from-the-wall">Power From The Wall</h5>

<p>The CHIP&rsquo;s microUSB connector is used to provide power from most any USB power source. USB wall-wart adapters are probably littered all over your house. If for some reason you don&rsquo;t have one, you can buy one from us or any electronics retailer. Just plug a USB-A-to-microUSB-B cable (that&rsquo;s the same cable most phones, tablets, and whatnot use to charge) into the wall-wart and CHIP, and you&rsquo;ll see the <code class="prettyprint">PWR</code>LED light up (forgive the underexposure, but you can see a small pink LED under the green one, and FWIW, LED colors may be different on your CHIP!).</p>

<p><img alt="CHIP indicator LEDs" src="images/chip_ledon.jpg" /></p>

<h5 id="power-from-a-battery">Power From a Battery</h5>

<p>CHIP can also be battery powered. Specifically, any single cell (1S) 3.7V Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery with a 2-pin JST-PH 2.0mm end can be connected to the JST-PH socket.</p>

<p><img alt="CHIP powered by a battery. Slick!" src="images/chip_battery.jpg" /></p>

<p>The JST can only plug it in one way, so if you are having a hard time lining things up, turn it around! Needless to say, do not force the battery connector into the socket if something doesn&rsquo;t feel right!</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s really great is that if you plug in to a charger and plug in a battery, the battery will charge - all the power management is on CHIP itself. Roughly, it takes about four to six hours to charge a 3000 mAh LiPo battery from a 5V 1A power source. Also, our delightful little Power Management IC, the AXP209, handles pass-through power, so while on and charging a battery, C.H.I.P. is basically running on a un-interruped power supply &ndash; If charge power fails, C.H.I.P. seamlessly switches onto battery power without shutting off.</p>

<h4 id="terminal-for-beginners-glossary">Terminal for Beginners Glossary</h4>

<p>One of the great things about Linux is the terminal application. While it may look unfriendly and terse, if you want to really extend the capabilities of CHIP, you&rsquo;ll often find yourself in the terminal. If you&rsquo;re a beginner, here&rsquo;s a quick reference of some really important and common commands.</p>

<ul>
<li> cd</li>
<li> ls</li>
<li> apt-get</li>
<li> pwd</li>
<li> grep</li>
<li>| (pipe)</li>
<li>&lt; (redirect)</li>
<li> cat</li>
<li> less</li>
<li> nano</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="connecting-accessories">Connecting Accessories</h3>

<p>CHIP has a lot of connectors, some for building, some for doing normal computer things. This section covers the normal computer things, like audio, video, and input.</p>

<h4 id="powered-usb-hub">Powered USB Hub</h4>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find that a simple powered USB hub is pretty essential if you want to use a lot of USB devices with CHIP. Not only is there only one USB port (keeping CHIP nice and small), but CHIP&rsquo;s micro USB power port can only provide so much power for the USB port. So if you don&rsquo;t have a powered USB port, you&rsquo;ll quickly max out power if you attach too many accessories. </p>

<p><img alt="powered USB hub connected to CHIP" src="images/chip_usbhub.jpg" /></p>

<h4 id="keyboard-and-mouse">Keyboard and Mouse</h4>

<p>Many keyboards have USB hubs built-in, so you can attach a mouse to the keyboard, attach the keyboard to CHIP, and immediately have control. However, it&rsquo;s likely the two will draw too much current, so you&rsquo;ll want to connect to a powered hub before you connect.</p>

<p><img alt="keyboard, mouse, and powered USB hub connected to CHIP" src="images/chip_usbconnections.jpg" /></p>

<h4 id="bluetooth-keyboard-and-mouse">Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse</h4>

<p>Of course, CHIP has built-in bluetooth, so if you want to use a keyboard and mouse, you can keep your USB port free for other things (like mass storage or a MIDI controller!) and keep your desk clean. See <a href="#Bluetooth">connecting to bluetooth section</a></p>

<h4 id="monitor">Monitor</h4>

<p>In the spirit of keeping things small, CHIP packs all the audio and video into a small TRRS (Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve) connector. Built-in video output is restricted to standard composite video resolution of 640x480. (Higher resolutions can be achieved with the upcoming VGA and DVI output accessories.) We also provide a breakout cable that lets you connect the audio and video to a TV (or other electronics) using RCA jacks.</p>

<p><img alt="monitor connected to CHIP" src="images/chip_withmonitor.jpg" /></p>

<h4 id="headphones">Headphones</h4>

<p>The audio and video connector on CHIP can be dedicated to audio output suitable for headphones or connecting to an amplifier for filling a room or public space with glorious sound. Just connect a standard 3.5 mm (1/8&quot;) TRS audio plug into CHIP&rsquo;s a/v jack.</p>

<p><img alt="CHIP connected to audio devices or groovy people listening to music" src="images/chip_withaudio.jpg" /></p>

<h4 id="microphone">Microphone</h4>

<p>Currently non-op - no driver.</p>

<h4 id="usb-storage">USB Storage</h4>

<p>If you have files that you want to modify, use, or transfer to CHIP&rsquo;s internal storage, you can attach a USB thumb drive, card-reader, or hard drive. Open the file manager and access the files.</p>

<p><img alt="USB drive attatched to CHIP" src="images/chip_usbstorage.jpg" /></p>

<h4 id="usb-audio">USB Audio</h4>

<p>CHIP can use Class-compliant USB audio devices. A popular, inexpensive choice for small computers are USB dongles based on the C-Media chipset. Search your favorite online store for &ldquo;C-Media USB audio&rdquo;. These have been tested successfully with CHIP and can often be purchased for less than $10. Some good resources for linux and audio compatibility are:</p>

<ul>
<li> http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/hardware_matrix</li>
<li> http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the drivers have not been tested with CHIP - as CHIP matures, more information will be available. For now, we recommened USB Class-compliant or &ldquo;plug-and-play&rdquo; audio devices.</p>

<h4 id="battery-and-charging">Battery and Charging *</h4>

<p>Like any modern laptop, CHIP can run and charge any single-cell LiPo battery. Read more in the <a href="#powerchip">powering CHIP section</a>.</p>
