# Welcome to DERP

We made a computer. *A $9 computer*. And every computer needs an operating system. 

Ours is **DERP**: **D**ebian **E**nvironment for **R**adical **P**roducts. Grab an old TV (or any screen with a composite video input), a keyboard and mouse, and stick some electricity  in the micro USB port. In a few seconds, you'll have CHIP's DERP on your screen, ready to do computer things.

CHIP is built for making - we've packed a powerful processor, 8 GB of storage, stereo audio, video out,  and lots of connections for playing and making your projects and products. 

DERP is built for doing. You probably didn't expect to be able to browse the 'net, send email, play video games, listen to music, write a novel, watch a video, or learn programming. And because it's based on the popular linux debian, if there's something you need, you can probably install it. 

So how do use this thing? Read on and learn how much you can do.
