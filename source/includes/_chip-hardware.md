## Parts and Pieces

## Wireless
### WiFi
description of wifi hardware.
### Bluetooth
description of bt hardware
## Connectors
Connect things to chip with the connectors
### USB
technical overview of USB hardware
### Audio
technical overview of audio hardware.
Audio Input uses the same connection on the TRRS connector as the composite video signal. If you want to make audio input active on the TRRS connector, you need to cut a circuit board trace. This is not as permanent as it sounds, as it is easy to re-enable composite video out with a small amount of soldering.
### USB On The Go
technical overview of USB-OTG hardware. How to configure different capabilities in software.
### Pin Headers
technical overview of pin headers (probably best handled in Making Stuff, though)
