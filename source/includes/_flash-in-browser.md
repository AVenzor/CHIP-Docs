# Flash CHIP With an OS

You might want (or need) to completely re-flash your CHIP with a different operating system. We've made it really easy to do this by embedding the entire process in a browser-based application. 


## Things you will need

 * C.H.I.P.
 * Standard-USB to micro-USB connector
 * Thin Paper clip (a jumper wire works too)
 * Computer with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) browser
 
## Instructions

If you don't have the Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or the open-source [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) browser, install it by following the preceding links.

Ok, good. Now that you have installed the browser, you can visit [flash.getchip.com](http://flash.getchip.com) in Chrome or Chromium and follow all the instructions. If you are using a computer with USB3 ports, it's suggested that you attach a USB2-compliant hub and connect your CHIP to the hub, instead of directly to the USB3 port.

It's possible to run the entire operation online. There are also options for downloading the OS image to your harddrive, then flashing your CHIP with no additional need for internet access. 

## The SDK Way

You may not want to use the browser-based flashing procedure. If this is the case, or you need additional tools, you can flash using the [CHIP SDK](#flash-chip-firmware)
