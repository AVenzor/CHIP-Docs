# C.H.I.P. and Composite Video
C.H.I.P. comes with a 1/8" (3.5mm) Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve (TRRS) jack, capable of carrying stereo audio, and either composite video out, or microphone in.

This is a fairly common port, but there are a few different arrangements of the conductors, so not all cables are equal.  Fortunately, C.H.I.P. uses the same conductor arrangement as Pi, Zune, and iPod audio/video cables, so the most common "mini to RCA A/V" cables should work just fine.

Some cables will route signals a bit differently, using the Red RCA cable for Video instead of Yellow.  If video out isn't working through the yellow cable, see if red works.  If not, your cable may be a version that's arranged in a way that it just won't work with C.H.I.P.

C.H.I.P.s (except the very first shipment of Alpha C.H.I.P.s) ship with cables confirmed to work using this arrangement:

  * yellow : video
  * red : stereo audio right channel
  * white : stereo audio left channel

The conductors on the TRRS plug are arranged like this:
